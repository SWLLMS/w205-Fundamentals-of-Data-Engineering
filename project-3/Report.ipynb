    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You're a data scientist at a game development company\n",
    "- Your latest mobile game has two events you're interested in tracking: ```buy a sword``` & ```join guild```\n",
    "- Each has metadata characterstic of such events (i.e., sword type, guild name, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instrument your API server to log events to Kafka\n",
    "- Assemble a data pipeline to catch these events: use Spark streaming to filter select event types from Kafka, land them into HDFS/parquet to make them available for analysis using Presto\n",
    "- Use Apache Bench to generate test data for your pipeline\n",
    "- Produce an analytics report where you provide a description of your pipeline and some basic analysis of the events\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a notebook to present your queries and findings. Remember that this notebook should be appropriate for presentation to someone else in your business who needs to act on your recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's understood that events in this pipeline are generated events which make them hard to connect to actual business decisions. However, we'd like students to demonstrate an ability to plumb this pipeline end-to-end, which includes initially generating test data as well as submitting a notebook-based report of at least simple event analytics.\n",
